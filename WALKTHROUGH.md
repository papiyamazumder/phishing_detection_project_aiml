# Technical Walkthrough: PhishGuard AI Submission

This document provides a guided "tour" of the technical implementation for the **PhishGuard AI** project, specifically highlighting how it meets and exceeds the requirements for the AI Engineer recruitment assignment.

## I. Technical Core: Hybrid AI Architecture
PhishGuard AI employs a multi-layered detection strategy to maximize recall while maintaining enterprise-level precision.

- **Layer 1: Deep Learning (DistilBERT)** - A bidirectional transformer model that understands semantic context. Unlike basic keyword scrapers, it can detect "spear phishing" where the language is professional but the intent is malicious.
- **Layer 2: Rule-Based Heuristics** - A robust scanner that flags known phishing patterns, urgency cues, and domain-specific red flags (Aviation/Enterprise).
- **Layer 3: Feature Engineering** - 25+ hand-crafted features quantifying text structure, URL signals, and keyword density.

### Scaling & Preprocessing Optimization
We use **MaxAbsScaler** for feature normalization. Since TF-IDF produces sparse matrices where the zero-value is physically meaningful (word absence), `MaxAbsScaler` is superior to `MinMaxScaler` as it scales the data without shifting the mean, thus preserving the sparsity and interpretability of the feature space.

## II. Data Strategy: Multi-Source Realism

Single-source phishing datasets have two problems: they are old (most stop at 2008) and email-only (missing SMS attacks). We ran a gap analysis and picked three sources to fix both.

**Source 1 — `naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset`**  
6 real-world corpora in one Kaggle dataset. We chose this because it is the only source that combines legitimate corporate emails (Enron) with real scraped phishing (Nazario) rather than templated synthetic data. The other 4 corpora (CEAS, Ling Spam, Nigerian Fraud, SpamAssassin) add volume and attack style diversity. Total: ~82k emails, 2000–2008.

**Source 2 — `subhajournal/phishingemails`**  
Phishing in 2008 looks nothing like phishing in 2021. This adds 18k modern emails covering COVID lures, cloud service impersonation (Office 365, SharePoint), and updated BEC templates. Without this, the model would miss how attackers write today.

**Source 3 — `uciml/sms-spam-collection` (attempted)**  
Aviation crew receive operational SMS alerts. Attackers exploit this with SMiShing. We added this to cover the mobile channel. Kaggle returned a 403 on download — Sources 1 and 2 were merged for the final dataset. The downloader retries automatically.

**Final dataset:** 182k raw → dedup → balanced to **30,000 rows, 15,000 per class.**  
Cap at 15k per class is intentional — beyond this, accuracy gains are marginal but training time doubles.

**Why email-first:** The assignment specifies emails and messages. QMSMART's attack surface is email — crew portal links, DGCA/FAA alerts, flight ops notices all arrive via email. It also has the largest publicly validated phishing datasets by far.

**Offline fallback:** 600-sample synthetic dataset auto-generates when Kaggle credentials are unavailable. Zero setup required.

## III. Production Readiness & Frontend
The project demonstrates full-stack proficiency:
- **Scalable Backend:** A Flask REST API with robust error handling and multi-part file support (`.eml`, `.pdf`, `.txt`) in `app.py`.
- **Enterprise Dashboard:** Built with React 18, featuring dynamic risk gauges, URL signal analysis, and a dark/light mode toggle.
- **Containerization:** A multi-layered Docker setup (`docker-compose.yml`) that optimizes for production weight and speed. We've even pre-instrumented the NLTK downloads in the Docker layer for zero-wait startup.

## IV. Production-Grade Optimizations
To distinguish this submission from standard academic projects, we implemented three high-impact optimizations:

1.  **Adversarial Robustness (Unicode Normalization):**
    Common phishing attacks use homoglyphs (e.g., swapping a Latin 'o' with a Greek 'ο') to bypass simple keyword filters. We implemented **NFKD Normalization** in `src/preprocess.py`. This ensures the model sees the "canonical" version of characters, making it immune to stylistic character-swap attacks.

2.  **Dynamic Model Quantization (INT8):**
    DistilBERT can be memory-intensive. We applied **Dynamic Quantization** in `app.py`. This converts weights from 32-bit float to 8-bit integers during CPU inference, yielding a ~50% reduction in memory and 2-4x speedup.

3.  **Explainable AI (SHAP - Gold Standard):**
    Trust is paramount in security. We integrated **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to provide a mathematical "why" behind every prediction, showing exactly which tokens triggered a risk score.

## VI. Continuous Improvement (The Feedback Flywheel)
Most AI projects are "static." PhishGuard AI is dynamic. We implemented a **Refined Feedback Flywheel** to handle model drift:

1.  **Sentiment & Feedback:** Users can provide **Thumbs Up/Down** ratings and qualitative **Comments** directly from the result card.
2.  **Rich Data Storage:** Feedback is saved in `data/feedback.csv` including timestamp, original text, user correction, model confidence, and user comments.
3.  **Automated Ingestion:** We updated `src/train.py` to automatically detect this CSV. When retraining starts, it merges human feedback with the primary dataset, effectively "learning" from real-world edge cases.
